# Python-Notebooks
Repository for all Python Notebooks I work with or build from.
#### Disclaimer! I leverage either Azure or GCP for most coding as I develop E2E systems that usually require some form of virtual machine or Kubernetes to deploy and run.

## Table of Contents
- **Chatbot Scripts:** Contain any Python scripts related to deployed chatbots.
- **Game Scripts:** Contain any Python scripts related to deployable games.
- **General Python Scripts:** Contain any Python scripts that do not have a grouping.
- **Google Cloud Platform Scripts:** Contain any Python scripts related to GCP system or data manipulation. This is not all GCP scripts as some belong to OCR/Image Recognition/Chatbot categories.
